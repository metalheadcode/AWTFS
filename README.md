# 🍎 AWTFS

AWTFS (Apple Web Template Font & Space) is a starter project that brings Apple's design language to your web projects! ✨

It features Apple's beautiful typefaces:

- "SF Pro Display" for headings
- "SF Pro Text" for body content

I've tried my best to follow Apple's design principles, but I'd love your help to make it even better! 👀 If you spot any spacing, kerning, or margin issues that need fixing, please jump in and contribute. Let's make this resource amazing for everyone in the community!
